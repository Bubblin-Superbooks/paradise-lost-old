True is, mee also he hath judg&rsquo;d, or rather Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape Man I deceav&rsquo;d: that which to mee belongs, Is enmity, which he will put between Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: A World who would not purchase with a bruise, Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th&rsquo; account Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, But up and enter now into full bliss.</p></div> </div>
