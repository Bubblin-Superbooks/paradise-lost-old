Because thou hast heark&rsquo;nd to the voice of thy Wife, And eaten of the Tree concerning which I charg&rsquo;d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, Curs&rsquo;d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid, and thou shalt eate th&rsquo; Herb of th&rsquo; Field, In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread, Till thou return unto the ground, for thou Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.</p></div> </div>
