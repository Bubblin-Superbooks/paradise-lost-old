A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire The Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav&rsquo;ns.</p><p>He ceas&rsquo;d, discerning Adam with such joy Surcharg&rsquo;d, as had like grief bin dew&rsquo;d in tears, Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.</p><p>O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher Of utmost hope! now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, Why our great expectation should be call&rsquo;d The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, High in the love of Heav&rsquo;n, yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son Of God most High;</p></div> </div>
