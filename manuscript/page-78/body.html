<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>d, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam&rsquo;d reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav&rsquo;n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav&rsquo;n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of som new Race call&rsquo;d Man, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour&rsquo;d more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc&rsquo;d among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav&rsquo;ns whol circumference, confirm&rsquo;d.</p></div> </div>
