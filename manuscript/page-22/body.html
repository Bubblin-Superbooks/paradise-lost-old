<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If then his Providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, Our labour must be to pervert that end, And out of good still to find means of evil; Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from their destind aim. But see the angry Victor hath recall&rsquo;d His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the Gates of Heav&rsquo;n: The Sulphurous Hail Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice Of Heav&rsquo;n receiv&rsquo;d us falling, and the Thunder, Wing&rsquo;d with red Lightning and impetuous rage, Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. Let us not slip th&rsquo; occasion, whether scorn, Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</p></div> </div>
