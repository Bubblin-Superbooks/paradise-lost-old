Wherever thus created, for no place Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know&rsquo;st He brought thee into this delicious Grove, This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, Delectable both to behold and taste; And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th&rsquo; Earth yeelds, Varietie without end; but of the Tree Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, Thou mai&rsquo;st not; in the day thou eat&rsquo;st, thou di&rsquo;st; Death is the penaltie impos&rsquo;d, beware, And govern well thy appetite, least sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.</p></div> </div>
