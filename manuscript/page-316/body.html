Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz&rsquo;d, When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz&rsquo;d Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav&rsquo;n: Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc&rsquo;d His Armie, circumfus&rsquo;d on either Wing, Under thir Head imbodied all in one. Before him Power Divine his way prepar&rsquo;d; At his command the uprooted Hills retir&rsquo;d Each to his place, they heard his voice and went Obsequious, Heav&rsquo;n his wonted face renewd, And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil&rsquo;d. This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur&rsquo;d, And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.</p></div> </div>
