Whence Haile to thee, Eve rightly call&rsquo;d, Mother of all Mankind, Mother of all things living, since by thee Man is to live, and all things live for Man.</p><p>To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. Ill worthie I such title should belong To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind A help, became thy snare;</p></div> </div>
