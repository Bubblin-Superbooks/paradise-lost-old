<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mean while The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring New Heav&rsquo;n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell And after all thir tribulations long See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, For regal Scepter then no more shall need, God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods, Adore him, who to compass all this dies, Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.</p><p>No sooner had th&rsquo; Almighty ceas&rsquo;t, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav&rsquo;n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna&rsquo;s fill&rsquo;d Th&rsquo; eternal Regions:</p></div> </div>
