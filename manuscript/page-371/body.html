<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli&rsquo;d. How fully hast thou satisfi&rsquo;d mee, pure Intelligence of Heav&rsquo;n, Angel serene, And freed from intricacies, taught to live, The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, And not molest us, unless we our selves Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; Till warn&rsquo;d, or by experience taught, she learne, That not to know at large of things remote From use, obscure and suttle, but to know That which before us lies in daily life, Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, And renders us in things that most concerne Unpractis&rsquo;d, unprepar&rsquo;d, and still to seek.</p></div> </div>
