<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Assembl&rsquo;d Angels, and ye Powers return&rsquo;d From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, Nor troubl&rsquo;d at these tidings from the Earth, Which your sincerest care could not prevent, Foretold so lately what would come to pass, When first this Tempter cross&rsquo;d the Gulf from Hell. I told ye then he should prevail and speed On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc&rsquo;t And flatter&rsquo;d out of all, believing lies Against his Maker; no Decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his Fall, Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free Will, to her own inclining left In eevn scale. But fall&rsquo;n he is, and now What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass On his transgression, Death denounc&rsquo;t that day, Which he presumes already vain and void, Because not yet inflicted, as he fear&rsquo;d, By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.</p></div> </div>
