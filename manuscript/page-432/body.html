<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>d Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come And gaze, and worship thee of right declar&rsquo;d Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.</p><p>So talk&rsquo;d the spirited sly Snake; and Eve Yet more amaz&rsquo;d unwarie thus reply&rsquo;d.</p><p>Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov&rsquo;d: But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? For many are the Trees of God that grow In Paradise, and various, yet unknown To us, in such abundance lies our choice, As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, Still hanging incorruptible, till men Grow up to thir provision, and more hands Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.</p></div> </div>
