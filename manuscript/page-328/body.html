<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang&rsquo;d To hoarce or mute, though fall&rsquo;n on evil dayes, On evil dayes though fall&rsquo;n, and evil tongues; In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud, And solitude; yet not alone, while thou Visit&rsquo;st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, Urania, and fit audience find, though few. But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his Revellers, the Race Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares To rapture, till the savage clamor dround Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores: For thou art Heav&rsquo;nlie, shee an empty dreame.</p></div> </div>
