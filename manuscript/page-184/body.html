<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> my dwelling haply may not please Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould, To entertain you two, her widest Gates, And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, Not like these narrow limits, to receive Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. And should I at your harmless innocence Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg&rsquo;d, By conquering this new World, compels me now To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.</p><p>So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, The Tyrants plea, excus&rsquo;d his devilish deeds.</p></div> </div>
