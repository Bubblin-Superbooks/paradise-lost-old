<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>d huge affliction and dismay Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: At once as far as Angels kenn he views The dismal Situation waste and wilde, A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round As one great Furnace flam&rsquo;d, yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv&rsquo;d only to discover sights of woe, Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all; but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum&rsquo;d: Such place Eternal Justice had prepar&rsquo;d For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain&rsquo;d In utter darkness, and their portion set As far remov&rsquo;d from God and light of Heav&rsquo;n As from the Center thrice to th&rsquo; utmost Pole.</p></div> </div>
