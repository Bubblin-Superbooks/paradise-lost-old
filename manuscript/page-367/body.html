<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> An Edifice too large for him to fill, Lodg&rsquo;d in a small partition, and the rest Ordain&rsquo;d for uses to his Lord best known. The swiftness of those Circles attribute, Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, That to corporeal substances could adde Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav&rsquo;n Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv&rsquo;d In Eden, distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name. But this I urge, Admitting Motion in the Heav&rsquo;ns, to shew Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov&rsquo;d; Not that I so affirm, though so it seem To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. God to remove his wayes from human sense, Plac&rsquo;d Heav&rsquo;n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, If it presume, might erre in things too high, And no advantage gaine.</p></div> </div>
