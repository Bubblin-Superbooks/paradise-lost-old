<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I the praise Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey&rsquo;d. Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain&rsquo;d From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be In things to us forbidden, it might be wish&rsquo;d, For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. But come, so well refresh&rsquo;t, now let us play, As meet is, after such delicious Fare; For never did thy Beautie since the day I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn&rsquo;d With all perfections, so enflame my sense With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.</p><p>So said he, and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent, well understood Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.</p></div> </div>
