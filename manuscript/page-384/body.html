<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> not so is Man, But in degree, the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help, Or solace his defects. No need that thou Shouldst propagat, already infinite; And through all numbers absolute, though One; But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection, and beget Like of his like, his Image multipli&rsquo;d, In unitie defective, which requires Collateral love, and deerest amitie. Thou in thy secresie although alone, Best with thy self accompanied, seek&rsquo;st not Social communication, yet so pleas&rsquo;d, Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt Of Union or Communion, deifi&rsquo;d; I by conversing cannot these erect From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. Thus I embold&rsquo;nd spake, and freedom us&rsquo;d Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain&rsquo;d This answer from the gratious voice Divine.</p></div> </div>
