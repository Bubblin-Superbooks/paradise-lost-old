<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>d The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam&rsquo;d; This more delusive, not the touch, but taste Deceav&rsquo;d; they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit Chewd bitter Ashes, which th&rsquo; offended taste VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, VVith hatefullest disrelish writh&rsquo;d thir jaws VVith foot and cinders fill&rsquo;d; so oft they fell Into the same illusion, not as Man Whom they triumph&rsquo;d once lapst. Thus were they plagu&rsquo;d And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum&rsquo;d, Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number&rsquo;d days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc&rsquo;t.</p></div> </div>
