Such happy interview and fair event Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, And charming Symphonies attach&rsquo;d the heart Of Adam, soon enclin&rsquo;d to admit delight, The bent of Nature; which he thus express&rsquo;d.</p><p>True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, Much better seems this Vision, and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.</p></div> </div>
