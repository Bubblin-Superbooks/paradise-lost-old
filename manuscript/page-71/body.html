<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent&rsquo;rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov&rsquo;d Not mind us not offending, satisfi&rsquo;d With what is punish&rsquo;t; whence these raging fires Will slack&rsquo;n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur&rsquo;d not feel, Or chang&rsquo;d at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;</p></div> </div>
