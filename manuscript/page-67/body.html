<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav&rsquo;n are fill&rsquo;d With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav&rsquo;ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th&rsquo; Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious. Thus repuls&rsquo;d, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th&rsquo; Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure;</p></div> </div>
