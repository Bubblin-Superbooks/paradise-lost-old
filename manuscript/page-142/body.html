<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Almighty Father shines, Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, Transfus&rsquo;d on thee his ample Spirit rests. Hee Heav&rsquo;n of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created, and by thee threw down Th&rsquo; aspiring Dominations: thou that day Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook Heav&rsquo;ns everlasting Frame, while o&rsquo;re the necks Thou drov&rsquo;st of warring Angels disarraid. Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might, To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, Not so on Man; him through their malice fall&rsquo;n, Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: No sooner did thy dear and onely Son Perceive thee purpos&rsquo;d not to doom frail Man So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
