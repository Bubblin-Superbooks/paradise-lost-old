<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>d with vain desire, Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest, What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, With thee it came and goes: but follow me, And I will bring thee where no shadow staies Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call&rsquo;d Mother of human Race: what could I doe, But follow strait, invisibly thus led? Till I espi&rsquo;d thee, fair indeed and tall, Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, Thou following cryd&rsquo;st aloud, Return fair Eve, Whom fli&rsquo;st thou? whom thou fli&rsquo;st, of him thou art, His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart Substantial Life, to have thee by my side Henceforth an individual solace dear;</p></div> </div>
