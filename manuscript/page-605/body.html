Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav&rsquo;n: at length Thir Ministry perform&rsquo;d, and race well run, Thir doctrine and thir story written left, They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav&rsquo;n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition, and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint, Left onely in those written Records pure, Though not but by the Spirit understood.</p></div> </div>
