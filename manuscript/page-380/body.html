As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold Approaching two and two, These cowring low With blandishment, each Bird stoop&rsquo;d on his wing. I nam&rsquo;d them, as they pass&rsquo;d, and understood Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu&rsquo;d My sudden apprehension: but in these I found not what me thought I wanted still; And to the Heav&rsquo;nly vision thus presum&rsquo;d.</p><p>O by what Name, for thou above all these, Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, Surpassest farr my naming, how may I Adore thee, Author of this Universe, And all this good to man, for whose well being So amply, and with hands so liberal Thou hast provided all things:</p></div> </div>
