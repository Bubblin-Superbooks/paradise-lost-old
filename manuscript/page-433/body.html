Empress, the way is readie, and not long, Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.</p><p>Lead then, said Eve.

Hope elevates, and joy Bright&rsquo;ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night Condenses, and the cold invirons round, Kindl&rsquo;d through agitation to a Flame, Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, Misleads th&rsquo; amaz&rsquo;d Night-wanderer from his way To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, There swallow&rsquo;d up and lost, from succour farr.</p></div> </div>
