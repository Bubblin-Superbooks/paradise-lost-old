<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought Miserie, uncreated till the crime Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill&rsquo;d Thy malice into thousands, once upright And faithful, now prov&rsquo;d false. But think not here To trouble Holy Rest; Heav&rsquo;n casts thee out From all her Confines. Heav&rsquo;n the seat of bliss Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. Hence then, and evil go with thee along Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, Or som more sudden vengeance wing&rsquo;d from God Precipitate thee with augmented paine.</p><p>So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds Thou canst not.</p></div> </div>
