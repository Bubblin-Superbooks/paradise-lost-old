<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> God saw, Surveying his great Work, that it was good: For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun A mightie Spheare he fram&rsquo;d, unlightsom first, Though of Ethereal Mould: then form&rsquo;d the Moon Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, And sowd with Starrs the Heav&rsquo;n thick as a field: Of Light by farr the greater part he took, Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac&rsquo;d In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine Her gather&rsquo;d beams, great Palace now of Light. Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs Repairing, in thir gold&rsquo;n Urns draw Light, And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; By tincture or reflection they augment Thir small peculiar, though from human sight So farr remote, with diminution seen.</p></div> </div>
