<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East To journie through the airie gloom began, Sphear&rsquo;d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle Sojourn&rsquo;d the while. God saw the Light was good; And light from darkness by the Hemisphere Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night He nam&rsquo;d. Thus was the first Day Eev&rsquo;n and Morn: Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; Birth-day of Heav&rsquo;n and Earth; with joy and shout The hollow Universal Orb they fill&rsquo;d, And touch&rsquo;t thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais&rsquo;d God and his works, Creatour him they sung, Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.</p></div> </div>
