<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov&rsquo;d, Disdainfully half smiling thus repli&rsquo;d. O loss of one in Heav&rsquo;n to judge of wise, Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, And now returns him from his prison scap&rsquo;t, Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither Unlicenc&rsquo;t from his bounds in Hell prescrib&rsquo;d; So wise he judges it to fly from pain However, and to scape his punishment. So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, Which thou incurr&rsquo;st by flying, meet thy flight Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain Can equal anger infinite provok&rsquo;t. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they Less hardie to endure?</p></div> </div>
