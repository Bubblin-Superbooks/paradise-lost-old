<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So glister&rsquo;d the dire Snake and into fraud Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree Of prohibition, root of all our woe; Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.</p><p>Serpent, we might have spar&rsquo;d our coming hither, Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; God so commanded, and left that Command Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.</p><p>To whom the Tempter guilefully repli&rsquo;d. Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, Yet Lords declar&rsquo;d of all in Earth or Aire?</p></div> </div>
