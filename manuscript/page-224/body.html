<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Awake My fairest, my espous&rsquo;d, my latest found, Heav&rsquo;ns last best gift, my ever new delight, Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed, How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.</p><p>Such whispering wak&rsquo;d her, but with startl&rsquo;d eye On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake.</p><p>O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see Thy face, and Morn return&rsquo;d, for I this Night, Such night till this I never pass&rsquo;d, have dream&rsquo;d, If dream&rsquo;d, not as I oft am wont, of thee, Works of day pass&rsquo;t, or morrows next designe, But of offence and trouble, which my mind Knew never till this irksom night;</p></div> </div>
