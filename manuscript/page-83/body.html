<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>O Progeny of Heav&rsquo;n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis&rsquo;d us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr&rsquo;d over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung&rsquo;d in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into what ever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov&rsquo;ranty, adorn&rsquo;d With splendor, arm&rsquo;d with power, if aught propos&rsquo;d And judg&rsquo;d of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterre Me from attempting.</p></div> </div>
