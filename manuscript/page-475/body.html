<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This Woman whom thou mad&rsquo;st to be my help, And gav&rsquo;st me as thy perfet gift, so good, So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, That from her hand I could suspect no ill, And what she did, whatever in it self, Her doing seem&rsquo;d to justifie the deed; Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.</p><p>To whom the sovran Presence thus repli&rsquo;d. Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, Superior, or but equal, that to her Thou did&rsquo;st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, And for thee, whose perfection farr excell&rsquo;d Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd She was indeed, and lovely to attract Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts Were such as under Government well seem&rsquo;d, Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part And person, had&rsquo;st thou known thy self aright.</p></div> </div>
