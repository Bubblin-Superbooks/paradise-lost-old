<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two Imparadis&rsquo;t in one anothers arms The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, Among our other torments not the least, Still unfulfill&rsquo;d with pain of longing pines; Yet let me not forget what I have gain&rsquo;d From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call&rsquo;d, Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd&rsquo;n? Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord Envie them that? can it be sin to know, Can it be death? and do they onely stand By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? O fair foundation laid whereon to build Thir ruine!</p></div> </div>
