<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Satan was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast, With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th&rsquo; undaunted Fiend what this might be admir&rsquo;d, Admir&rsquo;d, not fear&rsquo;d; God and his Son except, Created thing naught vallu&rsquo;d he nor shun&rsquo;d; And with disdainful look thus first began.</p><p>Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar&rsquo;st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur&rsquo;d, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav&rsquo;n.</p></div> </div>
