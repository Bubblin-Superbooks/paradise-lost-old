Greedily she ingorg&rsquo;d without restraint, And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, And hight&rsquo;nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, Thus to her self she pleasingly began.</p><p>O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees In Paradise, of operation blest To Sapience, hitherto obscur&rsquo;d, infam&rsquo;d, And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end Created; but henceforth my early care, Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease Of thy full branches offer&rsquo;d free to all; Till dieted by thee I grow mature In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;</p></div> </div>
