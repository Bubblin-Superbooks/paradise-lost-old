<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of these the vigilance I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. O foul descent! that I who erst contended With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, This essence to incarnate and imbrute, That to the hight of Deitie aspir&rsquo;d; But what will not Ambition and Revenge Descend to? who aspires must down as low As high he soard, obnoxious first or last To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim&rsquo;d, Since higher I fall short, on him who next Provokes my envie, this new Favorite Of Heav&rsquo;n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais&rsquo;d From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.</p></div> </div>
