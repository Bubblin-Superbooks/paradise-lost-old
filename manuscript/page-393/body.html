<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> love refines The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale By which to heav&rsquo;nly Love thou maist ascend, Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.</p><p>To whom thus half abash&rsquo;t Adam repli&rsquo;d. Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught In procreation common to all kindes (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, And with mysterious reverence I deem) So much delights me, as those graceful acts, Those thousand decencies that daily flow From all her words and actions, mixt with Love And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign&rsquo;d Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; Harmonie to behold in wedded pair More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.</p></div> </div>
