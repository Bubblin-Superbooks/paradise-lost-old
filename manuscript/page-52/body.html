<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid With Golden Architrave; nor did there want Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav&rsquo;n, The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equal&rsquo;d in all thir glories, to inshrine Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxurie. Th&rsquo; ascending pile Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores Op&rsquo;ning thir brazen foulds discover wide Within, her ample spaces, o&rsquo;re the smooth And level pavement: from the arched roof Pendant by suttle Magic many a row Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light As from a sky.</p></div> </div>
