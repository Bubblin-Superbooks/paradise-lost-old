<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As when a spark Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine With sudden blaze diffus&rsquo;d, inflames the Aire: So started up in his own shape the Fiend. Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz&rsquo;d So sudden to behold the grieslie King; Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.</p><p>Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg&rsquo;d to Hell Com&rsquo;st thou, escap&rsquo;d thy prison, and transform&rsquo;d, Why satst thou like an enemie in waite Here watching at the head of these that sleep?</p><p>Know ye not then said Satan, filld with scorn, Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, The lowest of your throng;</p></div> </div>
