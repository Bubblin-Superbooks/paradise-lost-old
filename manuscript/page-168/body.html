<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Me miserable! which way shall I flie Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatning to devour me opens wide, To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav&rsquo;n. O then at last relent: is there no place Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that word Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc&rsquo;d With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit, boasting I could subdue Th&rsquo; Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, Under what torments inwardly I groane; While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, With Diadem and Scepter high advanc&rsquo;d The lower still I fall, onely Supream In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.</p></div> </div>
