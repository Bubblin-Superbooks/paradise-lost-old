<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, And with them comes a third of Regal port, But faded splendor wan; who by his gate And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, Not likely to part hence without contest; Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.</p><p>He scarce had ended, when those two approachd And brief related whom they brought, wher found, How busied, in what form and posture coucht.</p><p>To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescrib&rsquo;d To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge Of others, who approve not to transgress By thy example, but have power and right To question thy bold entrance on this place; Imploi&rsquo;d it seems to violate sleep, and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?</p></div> </div>
