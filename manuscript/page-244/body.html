<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons Then with these various fruits the Trees of God Have heap&rsquo;d this Table. Rais&rsquo;d of grassie terf Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, And on her ample Square from side to side All Autumn pil&rsquo;d, though Spring and Autumn here Danc&rsquo;d hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began Our Authour. Heav&rsquo;nly stranger, please to taste These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom All perfet good unmeasur&rsquo;d out, descends, To us for food and for delight hath caus&rsquo;d The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps To spiritual Natures; only this I know, That one Celestial Father gives to all.</p></div> </div>
