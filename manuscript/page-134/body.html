<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> thou hast givn me to possess Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule For ever with corruption there to dwell; But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; Death his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm&rsquo;d. I through the ample Air in Triumph high Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight Pleas&rsquo;d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, While by thee rais&rsquo;d I ruin all my Foes, Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:</p></div> </div>
