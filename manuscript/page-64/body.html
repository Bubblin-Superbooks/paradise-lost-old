<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse. Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok&rsquo;n Rear Insulting, and pursu&rsquo;d us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low? Th&rsquo; ascent is easie then; Th&rsquo; event is fear&rsquo;d; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy&rsquo;d: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv&rsquo;n out from bliss, condemn&rsquo;d In this abhorred deep to utter woe;</p></div> </div>
