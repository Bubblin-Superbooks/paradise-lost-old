<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos&rsquo;d Answer&rsquo;d. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav&rsquo;ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav&rsquo;n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link&rsquo;d in a golden Chain To that side Heav&rsquo;n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; goe and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.</p></div> </div>
