<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So Man, as is most just, Shall satisfie for Man, be judg&rsquo;d and die, And dying rise, and rising with him raise His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. So Heav&rsquo;nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate, Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroy&rsquo;d, and still destroyes In those who, when they may, accept not grace. Nor shalt thou by descending to assume Mans Nature, less&rsquo;n or degrade thine owne. Because thou hast, though Thron&rsquo;d in highest bliss Equal to God, and equally enjoying God-like fruition, quitted all to save A World from utter loss, and hast been found By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, Found worthiest to be so by being Good, Farr more then Great or High; because in thee Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;</p></div> </div>
