<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To whom with healing words Adam reply&rsquo;d. Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid Th&rsquo; attempt it self, intended by our Foe. For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos&rsquo;d Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne And anger wouldst resent the offer&rsquo;d wrong, Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone, which on us both at once The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, Or daring, first on mee th&rsquo; assault shall light. Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.</p></div> </div>
