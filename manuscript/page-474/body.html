<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear&rsquo;d, But still rejoyc&rsquo;t, how is it now become So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?</p><p>To whom thus Adam sore beset repli&rsquo;d. O Heav&rsquo;n! in evil strait this day I stand Before my Judge, either to undergoe My self the total Crime, or to accuse My other self, the partner of my life; Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, I should conceal, and not expose to blame By my complaint; but strict necessitie Subdues me, and calamitous constraint, Least on my head both sin and punishment, However insupportable, be all Devolv&rsquo;d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.</p></div> </div>
