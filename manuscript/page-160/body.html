<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Earth, And in her pale dominion checks the night. That spot to which I point is Paradise, Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.</p><p>Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, Where honour due and reverence none neglects, Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, Down from th&rsquo; Ecliptic, sped with hop&rsquo;d success, Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.</p></div> </div>
