<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such was thir awe of man. In shadier Bower More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs Espoused Eve deckt first her Nuptial Bed, And heav&rsquo;nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, What day the genial Angel to our Sire Brought her in naked beauty more adorn&rsquo;d, More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like In sad event, when to the unwiser Son Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar&rsquo;d Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng&rsquo;d On him who had stole Joves authentic fire.</p><p>Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv&rsquo;d, both stood, Both turnd, and under op&rsquo;n Skie ador&rsquo;d The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
