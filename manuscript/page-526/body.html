<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>n down Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, And sends a comfortable heat from farr, Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, And what may else be remedie or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace Beseeching him, so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life, sustain&rsquo;d By him with many comforts, till we end In dust, our final rest and native home. What better can we do, then to the place Repairing where he judg&rsquo;d us, prostrate fall Before him reverent, and there confess Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign&rsquo;d, and humiliation meek.</p></div> </div>
