<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was at first as other Beasts that graze The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, As was my food, nor aught but food discern&rsquo;d Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc&rsquo;d A goodly Tree farr distant to behold Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; When from the boughes a savorie odour blow&rsquo;n, Grateful to appetite, more pleas&rsquo;d my sense Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. To satisfie the sharp desire I had Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv&rsquo;d Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, Powerful perswaders, quick&rsquo;nd at the scent Of that alluring fruit, urg&rsquo;d me so keene.</p></div> </div>
