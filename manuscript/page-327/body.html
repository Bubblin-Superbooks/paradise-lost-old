The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top Of old Olympus dwell&rsquo;st, but Heav&rsquo;nlie borne, Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow&rsquo;d, Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play In presence of th&rsquo; Almightie Father, pleas&rsquo;d With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee Into the Heav&rsquo;n of Heav&rsquo;ns I have presum&rsquo;d, An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down Return me to my Native Element: Least from this flying Steed unrein&rsquo;d, (as once Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime) Dismounted, on th&rsquo; Aleian Field I fall Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.</p></div> </div>
