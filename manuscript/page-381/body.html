<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> but with mee I see not who partakes. In solitude What happiness, who can enjoy alone, Or all enjoying, what contentment find? Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, As with a smile more bright&rsquo;nd, thus repli&rsquo;d.</p><p>What call&rsquo;st thou solitude, is not the Earth With various living creatures, and the Aire Replenisht, and all these at thy command To come and play before thee, know&rsquo;st thou not Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, And reason not contemptibly; with these Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. So spake the Universal Lord, and seem&rsquo;d So ordering. I with leave of speech implor&rsquo;d, And humble deprecation thus repli&rsquo;d.</p></div> </div>
