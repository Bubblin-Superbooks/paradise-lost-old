<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Can thus Th&rsquo; Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect, though faultie since, To such unsightly sufferings be debas&rsquo;t Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, Retaining still Divine similitude In part, from such deformities be free, And for his Makers Image sake exempt?</p><p>Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then Forsook them, when themselves they villifi&rsquo;d To serve ungovern&rsquo;d appetite, and took His Image whom they serv&rsquo;d, a brutish vice, Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. Therefore so abject is thir punishment, Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, Or if his likeness, by themselves defac&rsquo;t While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.</p></div> </div>
