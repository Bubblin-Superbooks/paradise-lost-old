<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What matter where, if I be still the same, And what I should be, all but less then hee Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least We shall be free; th&rsquo; Almighty hath not built Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav&rsquo;n. But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, Th&rsquo; associates and copartners of our loss Lye thus astonisht on th&rsquo; oblivious Pool, And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy Mansion, or once more With rallied Arms to try what may be yet Regaind in Heav&rsquo;n, or what more lost in Hell?</p></div> </div>
