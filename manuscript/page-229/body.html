Be not disheart&rsquo;nd then, nor cloud those looks That wont to be more chearful and serene Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, And let us to our fresh imployments rise Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours That open now thir choicest bosom&rsquo;d smells Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.</p><p>So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, But silently a gentle tear let fall From either eye, and wip&rsquo;d them with her haire; Two other precious drops that ready stood, Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell Kiss&rsquo;d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse And pious awe, that feard to have offended.</p></div> </div>
