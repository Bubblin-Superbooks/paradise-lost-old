As when a flock Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, Against the day of Battel, to a Field, Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur&rsquo;d With sent of living Carcasses design&rsquo;d For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. So sented the grim Feature, and upturn&rsquo;d His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.</p></div> </div>
