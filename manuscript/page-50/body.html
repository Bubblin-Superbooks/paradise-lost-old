<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mammon led them on, Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav&rsquo;n, for ev&rsquo;n in heav&rsquo;n his looks & thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heav&rsquo;ns pavement, trod&rsquo;n Gold, Then aught divine or holy else enjoy&rsquo;d In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught, Ransack&rsquo;d the Center, and with impious hands Rifl&rsquo;d the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Op&rsquo;nd into the Hill a spacious wound And dig&rsquo;d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best Deserve the pretious bane.</p></div> </div>
