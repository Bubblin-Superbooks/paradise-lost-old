<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Our greatness will appear Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e&rsquo;re Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and endurance. This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav&rsquo;ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur&rsquo;d, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must&rsquo;ring thir rage, and Heav&rsquo;n resembles Hell? As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav&rsquo;n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang&rsquo;d Into their temper;</p></div> </div>
