<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future days may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe.</p><p>Thus Belial with words cloath&rsquo;d in reasons garb Counsel&rsquo;d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake.</p><p>Either to disinthrone the King of Heav&rsquo;n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav&rsquo;ns bound, unless Heav&rsquo;ns Lord supream We overpower? Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection;</p></div> </div>
