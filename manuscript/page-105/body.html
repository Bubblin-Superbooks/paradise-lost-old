<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>d Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th&rsquo; unfounded deep, & through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav&rsquo;n, and therein plac&rsquo;t A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov&rsquo;d, Least Heav&rsquo;n surcharg&rsquo;d with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design&rsquo;d, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm&rsquo;d With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill&rsquo;d Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.</p></div> </div>
