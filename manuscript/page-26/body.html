<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Him followed his next Mate, Both glorying to have scap&rsquo;t the Stygian flood As Gods, and by their own recover&rsquo;d strength, Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</p><p>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat That we must change for Heav&rsquo;n, this mournful gloom For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid What shall be right: fardest from him is best Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be chang&rsquo;d by Place or Time. The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav&rsquo;n of Hell, a Hell of Heav&rsquo;n.</p></div> </div>
