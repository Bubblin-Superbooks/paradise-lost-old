Warr therefore, open or conceal&rsquo;d, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav&rsquo;ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav&rsquo;n Thus trampl&rsquo;d, thus expell&rsquo;d to suffer here Chains & these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv&rsquo;d, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.</p></div> </div>
