<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> well we may afford Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies Her fertil growth, and by disburd&rsquo;ning grows More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.</p><p>To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, Of God inspir&rsquo;d, small store will serve, where store, All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; Save what by frugal storing firmness gains To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: But I will haste and from each bough and break, Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice To entertain our Angel guest, as hee Beholding shall confess that here on Earth God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav&rsquo;n.</p></div> </div>
