<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, To good malignant, to bad men benigne, Under her own waight groaning, till the day Appeer of respiration to the just, And vengeance to the wicked, at return Of him so lately promis&rsquo;d to thy aid, The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, Last in the Clouds from Heav&rsquo;n to be reveald In glory of the Father, to dissolve Satan with his perverted World, then raise From the conflagrant mass, purg&rsquo;d and refin&rsquo;d, New Heav&rsquo;ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love, To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.</p><p>He ended; and thus Adam last reply&rsquo;d.</p></div> </div>
