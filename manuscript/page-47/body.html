<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> but what power of mind Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth Of knowledge past or present, could have fear&rsquo;d, How such united force of Gods, how such As stood like these, could ever know repulse? For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, That all these puissant Legions, whose exile Hath emptied Heav&rsquo;n, shall faile to re-ascend Self-rais&rsquo;d, and repossess their native seat. For me, be witness all the Host of Heav&rsquo;n, If counsels different, or danger shun&rsquo;d By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns Monarch in Heav&rsquo;n, till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, Consent or custome, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal&rsquo;d, Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</p></div> </div>
