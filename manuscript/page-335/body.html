Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav&rsquo;n, And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep Within appointed bounds be Heav&rsquo;n and Earth, Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.</p></div> </div>
