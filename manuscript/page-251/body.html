Son of Heav&rsquo;n and Earth, Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; That thou continu&rsquo;st such, owe to thy self, That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. This was that caution giv&rsquo;n thee; be advis&rsquo;d. God made thee perfet, not immutable; And good he made thee, but to persevere He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will By nature free, not over-rul&rsquo;d by Fate Inextricable, or strict necessity; Our voluntarie service he requires, Not our necessitated, such with him Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how Can hearts, not free, be tri&rsquo;d whether they serve Willing or no, who will but what they must By Destinie, and can no other choose? My self and all th&rsquo; Angelic Host that stand In sight of God enthron&rsquo;d, our happie state Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; On other surety none; freely we serve.</p></div> </div>
