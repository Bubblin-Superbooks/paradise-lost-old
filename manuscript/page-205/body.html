<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, Or Serenate, which the starv&rsquo;d Lover sings To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair&rsquo;d. Sleep on, Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek No happier state, and know to know no more.</p><p>Now had night measur&rsquo;d with her shaddowie Cone Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim Forth issuing at th&rsquo; accustomd hour stood armd To thir night watches in warlike Parade, When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.</p></div> </div>
