<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>n as my thoughts are, all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: Man shall not quite be lost, but sav&rsquo;d who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall&rsquo;d By sin to foul exorbitant desires; Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe, By me upheld, that he may know how frail His fall&rsquo;n condition is, and to me ow All his deliv&rsquo;rance, and to none but me. Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest; so is my will: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes Th&rsquo; incensed Deitie, while offerd grace Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, What may suffice, and soft&rsquo;n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.</p></div> </div>
