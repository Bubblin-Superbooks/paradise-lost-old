Adam observ&rsquo;d, and with his Eye the chase Pursuing, not unmov&rsquo;d to Eve thus spake.</p><p>O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, Which Heav&rsquo;n by these mute signs in Nature shews Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penaltie, because from death releast Some days; how long, and what till then our life, Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, And thither must return and be no more.</p></div> </div>
