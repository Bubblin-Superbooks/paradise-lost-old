Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers&rsquo;d Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen Among thick-wov&rsquo;n Arborets and Flours Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign&rsquo;d Or of reviv&rsquo;d Adonis, or renownd Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse.</p></div> </div>
