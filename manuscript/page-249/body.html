Wonder not then, what God for you saw good If I refuse not, but convert, as you, To proper substance; time may come when men With Angels may participate, and find No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: And from these corporal nutriments perhaps Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit Improv&rsquo;d by tract of time, and wingd ascend Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice Here or in Heav&rsquo;nly Paradises dwell;</p></div> </div>
