But the Field To labour calls us now with sweat impos&rsquo;d, Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, All unconcern&rsquo;d with our unrest, begins Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, I never from thy side henceforth to stray, Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? Here let us live, though in fall&rsquo;n state, content.</p><p>So spake, so wish&rsquo;d much-humbl&rsquo;d Eve, but Fate Subscrib&rsquo;d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
