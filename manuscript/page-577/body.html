Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad Greatly rejoyc&rsquo;d, and thus his joy broke forth.</p><p>O thou that future things canst represent As present, Heav&rsquo;nly instructer, I revive At this last sight, assur&rsquo;d that Man shall live With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just, That God voutsafes to raise another World From him, and all his anger to forget.</p></div> </div>
