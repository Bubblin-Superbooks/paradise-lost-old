<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Say Goddess, what ensu&rsquo;d when Raphael, The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn&rsquo;d Adam by dire example to beware Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven To those Apostates, least the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his Race, Charg&rsquo;d not to touch the interdicted Tree, If they transgress, and slight that sole command, So easily obeyd amid the choice Of all tasts else to please thir appetite, Though wandring. He with his consorted Eve The storie heard attentive, and was fill&rsquo;d With admiration, and deep Muse to heare Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought So unimaginable as hate in Heav&rsquo;n, And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss With such confusion: but the evil soon Driv&rsquo;n back redounded as a flood on those From whom it sprung, impossible to mix With Blessedness.</p></div> </div>
