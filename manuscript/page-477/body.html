Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.</p><p>So spake this Oracle, then verifi&rsquo;d When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav&rsquo;n, Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht In open shew, and with ascention bright Captivity led captive through the Aire, The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt, Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn&rsquo;d.</p></div> </div>
