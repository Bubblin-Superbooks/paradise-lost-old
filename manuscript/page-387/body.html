<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Under his forming hands a Creature grew, Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd And in her looks, which from that time infus&rsquo;d Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, And into all things from her Aire inspir&rsquo;d The spirit of love and amorous delight. She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak&rsquo;d To find her, or for ever to deplore Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable: On she came, Led by her Heav&rsquo;nly Maker, though unseen, And guided by his voice, nor uninformd Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: Grace was in all her steps, Heav&rsquo;n in her Eye, In every gesture dignitie and love. I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.</p></div> </div>
