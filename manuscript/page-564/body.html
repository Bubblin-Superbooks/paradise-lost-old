<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives Religious titl&rsquo;d them the Sons of God, Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.</p><p>To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. O pittie and shame, that they who to live well Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.</p><p>From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, Said th&rsquo; Angel, who should better hold his place By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. But now prepare thee for another Scene.</p></div> </div>
