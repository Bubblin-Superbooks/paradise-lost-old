Fast we found, fast shut The dismal Gates, and barricado&rsquo;d strong; But long ere our approaching heard within Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. Glad we return&rsquo;d up to the coasts of Light Ere Sabbath Eev&rsquo;ning: so we had in charge. But thy relation now; for I attend, Pleas&rsquo;d with thy words no less then thou with mine.</p><p>So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. For Man to tell how human Life began Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? Desire with thee still longer to converse Induc&rsquo;d me.</p></div> </div>
