<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> but of this cursed crew The punishment to other hand belongs, Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; Number to this dayes work is not ordain&rsquo;d Nor multitude, stand onely and behold Gods indignation on these Godless pourd By mee; not you but mee they have despis&rsquo;d, Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, Because the Father, t&rsquo; whom in Heav&rsquo;n supream Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, Hath honourd me according to his will. Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig&rsquo;n&rsquo;d; That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, Or I alone against them, since by strength They measure all, of other excellence Not emulous, nor care who them excells; Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.</p></div> </div>
