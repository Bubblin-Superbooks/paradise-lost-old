<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, Chaos and Ancient Night, I come no Spie, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome desart, as my way Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav&rsquo;n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th&rsquo; Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed, no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell&rsquo;d, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standerd there of Ancient Night; Yours be th&rsquo; advantage all, mine the revenge.</p></div> </div>
