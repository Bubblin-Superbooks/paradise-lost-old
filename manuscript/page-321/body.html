<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> the monstrous sight Strook them with horror backward, but far worse Urg&rsquo;d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw Down from the verge of Heav&rsquo;n, Eternal wrauth Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.</p><p>Hell heard th&rsquo; unsufferable noise, Hell saw Heav&rsquo;n ruining from Heav&rsquo;n and would have fled Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos&rsquo;d, Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. Disburd&rsquo;nd Heav&rsquo;n rejoic&rsquo;d, and soon repaird Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.</p></div> </div>
