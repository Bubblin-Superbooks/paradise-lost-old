<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm&rsquo;d Portending good, and all her spirits compos&rsquo;d To meek submission: thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, The great deliverance by her Seed to come (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. That ye may live, which will be many dayes, Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer&rsquo;d With meditation on the happie end.</p><p>He ended, and they both descend the Hill; Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak&rsquo;t; And thus with words not sad she him receav&rsquo;d.</p></div> </div>
