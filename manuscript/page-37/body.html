<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With these in troop Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call&rsquo;d Astarte, Queen of Heav&rsquo;n, with crescent Horns; To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon Sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, In Sion also not unsung, where stood Her Temple on th&rsquo; offensive Mountain, built By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, Beguil&rsquo;d by fair Idolatresses, fell To Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur&rsquo;d The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, While smooth Adonis from his native Rock Ran purple to the Sea, suppos&rsquo;d with blood Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale Infected Sions daughters with like heat, Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led His eye survay&rsquo;d the dark Idolatries Of alienated Judah.</p></div> </div>
