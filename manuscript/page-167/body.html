O had his powerful Destiny ordaind Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais&rsquo;d Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power As great might have aspir&rsquo;d, and me though mean Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great Fell not, but stand unshak&rsquo;n, from within Or from without, to all temptations arm&rsquo;d. Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, But Heav&rsquo;ns free Love dealt equally to all? Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, To me alike, it deals eternal woe. Nay curs&rsquo;d be thou; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues.</p></div> </div>
