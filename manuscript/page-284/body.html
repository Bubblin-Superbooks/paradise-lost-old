<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli&rsquo;d. Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find Of erring, from the path of truth remote: Unjustly thou deprav&rsquo;st it with the name Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, When he who rules is worthiest, and excells Them whom he governs. This is servitude, To serve th&rsquo; unwise, or him who hath rebelld Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall&rsquo;d; Yet leudly dar&rsquo;st our ministring upbraid. Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve In Heav&rsquo;n God ever blessed, and his Divine Behests obey, worthiest to be obey&rsquo;d, Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.</p></div> </div>
