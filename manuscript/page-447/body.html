On th&rsquo; other side, Adam, soon as he heard The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz&rsquo;d, Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax&rsquo;d; From his slack hand the Garland wreath&rsquo;d for Eve Down drop&rsquo;d, and all the faded Roses shed: Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length First to himself he inward silence broke.</p></div> </div>
