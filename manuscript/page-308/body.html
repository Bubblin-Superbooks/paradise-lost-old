Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, Of hard contents, and full of force urg&rsquo;d home, Such as we might perceive amus&rsquo;d them all, And stumbl&rsquo;d many, who receives them right, Had need from head to foot well understand; Not understood, this gift they have besides, They shew us when our foes walk not upright.</p><p>So they among themselves in pleasant veine Stood scoffing, highthn&rsquo;d in thir thoughts beyond All doubt of Victorie, eternal might To match with thir inventions they presum&rsquo;d So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, And all his Host derided, while they stood A while in trouble; but they stood not long, Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.</p></div> </div>
