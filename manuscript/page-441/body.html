<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For us alone Was death invented? or to us deni&rsquo;d This intellectual food, for beasts reserv&rsquo;d? For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy The good befall&rsquo;n him, Author unsuspect, Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. What fear I then, rather what know to feare Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?</p><p>So saying, her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck&rsquo;d, she eat: Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, That all was lost.</p></div> </div>
