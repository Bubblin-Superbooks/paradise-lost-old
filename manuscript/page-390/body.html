<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> here passion first I felt, Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmov&rsquo;d, here onely weake Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.

For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her th&rsquo; inferiour, in the mind And inward Faculties, which most excell, In outward also her resembling less His Image who made both, and less expressing The character of that Dominion giv&rsquo;n O&rsquo;re other Creatures; yet when I approach Her loveliness, so absolute she seems And in her self compleat, so well to know Her own, that what she wills to do or say, Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;</p></div> </div>
