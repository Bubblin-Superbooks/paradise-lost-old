<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now Morn her rosie steps in th&rsquo; Eastern Clime Advancing, sow&rsquo;d the Earth with Orient Pearle, When Adam wak&rsquo;t, so customd, for his sleep Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred, And temperat vapors bland, which th&rsquo; only sound Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora&rsquo;s fan, Lightly dispers&rsquo;d, and the shrill Matin Song Of Birds on every bough; so much the more His wonder was to find unwak&rsquo;nd Eve With Tresses discompos&rsquo;d, and glowing Cheek, As through unquiet rest: he on his side Leaning half-rais&rsquo;d, with looks of cordial Love Hung over her enamour&rsquo;d, and beheld Beautie, which whether waking or asleep, Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice Milde, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.</p></div> </div>
