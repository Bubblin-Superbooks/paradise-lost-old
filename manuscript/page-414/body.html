<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, With sweet austeer composure thus reply&rsquo;d.</p><p>Ofspring of Heav&rsquo;n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, That such an enemie we have, who seeks Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, And from the parting Angel over-heard As in a shadie nook I stood behind, Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt To God or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear. His violence thou fearst not, being such, As wee, not capable of death or paine, Can either not receave, or can repell. His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love Can by his fraud be shak&rsquo;n or seduc&rsquo;t; Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear?</p></div> </div>
