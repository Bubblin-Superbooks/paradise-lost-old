For this he shall live hated, be blasphem&rsquo;d, Seis&rsquo;d on by force, judg&rsquo;d, and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, The Law that is against thee, and the sins Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi&rsquo;d, Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no power Shall long usurp;</p></div> </div>
