So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, They trespass, Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formd them free, and free they must remain, Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain&rsquo;d Thir freedom, they themselves ordain&rsquo;d thir fall. The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, Self-tempted, self-deprav&rsquo;d: Man falls deceiv&rsquo;d By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, Through Heav&rsquo;n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.</p></div> </div>
