<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> O flours, That never will in other Climate grow, My early visitation, and my last At Eev&rsquo;n, which I bred up with tender hand From the first op&rsquo;ning bud, and gave ye Names, Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke Your Tribes, and water from th&rsquo; ambrosial Fount? Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee How shall I part, and whither wander down Into a lower World, to this obscure And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?</p><p>Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; Where he abides, think there thy native soile.</p></div> </div>
