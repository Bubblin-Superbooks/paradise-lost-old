Up he rode Followd with acclamation and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun&rsquo;d Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire Resounded, (thou remember&rsquo;st, for thou heardst) The Heav&rsquo;ns and all the Constellations rung, The Planets in thir stations list&rsquo;ning stood, While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.</p></div> </div>
