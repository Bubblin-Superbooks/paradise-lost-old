At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon Among them he arriv&rsquo;d; in his right hand Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent Before him, such as in thir Soules infix&rsquo;d Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, All courage; down thir idle weapons drop&rsquo;d; O&rsquo;re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, That wish&rsquo;d the Mountains now might be again Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.</p></div> </div>
