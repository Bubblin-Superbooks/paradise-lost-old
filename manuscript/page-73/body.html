<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos&rsquo;d, to celebrate his Throne With warbl&rsquo;d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing Forc&rsquo;t Halleluiah&rsquo;s; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings. This must be our task In Heav&rsquo;n, this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain&rsquo;d Unacceptable, though in Heav&rsquo;n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp.</p></div> </div>
