<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But whether thus these things, or whether not, Whether the Sun predominant in Heav&rsquo;n Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun, Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, Or Shee from West her silent course advance With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev&rsquo;n, And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along, Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, Wherever plac&rsquo;t, let him dispose: joy thou In what he gives to thee, this Paradise And thy faire Eve; Heav&rsquo;n is for thee too high To know what passes there; be lowlie wise: Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there Live, in what state, condition or degree, Contented that thus farr hath been reveal&rsquo;d Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav&rsquo;n.</p></div> </div>
