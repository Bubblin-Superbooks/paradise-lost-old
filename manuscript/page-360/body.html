<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> but to create Is greater then created to destroy. Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes To lessen thee, against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might: his evil Thou usest, and from thence creat&rsquo;st more good. Witness this new-made World, another Heav&rsquo;n From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr&rsquo;s Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World Of destind habitation; but thou know&rsquo;st Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus&rsquo;d, Thir pleasant dwelling place.</p></div> </div>
