I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; To find thee I directed then my walk; And on, methought, alone I pass&rsquo;d through ways That brought me on a sudden to the Tree Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem&rsquo;d, Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood One shap&rsquo;d & wing&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
