<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, As at th&rsquo; Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag&rsquo;d in the troubl&rsquo;d Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav&rsquo;n the welkin burns. Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oealia Crown&rsquo;d With conquest, felt th&rsquo; envenom&rsquo;d robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th&rsquo; Euboic Sea.</p></div> </div>
