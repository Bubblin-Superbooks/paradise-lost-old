<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, So now of what thou knowst not, who desir&rsquo;st The punishment all on thy self; alas, Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers Could alter high Decrees, I to that place Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, That on my head all might be visited, Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv&rsquo;n, To me committed and by me expos&rsquo;d. But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame Each other, blam&rsquo;d enough elsewhere, but strive In offices of Love, how we may light&rsquo;n Each others burden in our share of woe; Since this days Death denounc&rsquo;t, if ought I see, Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac&rsquo;t evill, A long days dying to augment our paine, And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv&rsquo;d.</p></div> </div>
