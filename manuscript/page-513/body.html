O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv&rsquo;n me; out of which I find no way, from deep to deeper plung&rsquo;d!</p><p>Thus Adam to himself lamented loud Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, Which to his evil Conscience represented All things with double terror: On the ground Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft Curs&rsquo;d his Creation, Death as oft accus&rsquo;d Of tardie execution, since denounc&rsquo;t The day of his offence.</p></div> </div>
