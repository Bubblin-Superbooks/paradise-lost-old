<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, Into our room of bliss thus high advanc&rsquo;t Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, Not Spirits, yet to heav&rsquo;nly Spirits bright Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder, and could love, so lively shines In them Divine resemblance, and such grace The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh Your change approaches, when all these delights Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; Happie, but for so happie ill secur&rsquo;d Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav&rsquo;n Ill fenc&rsquo;t for Heav&rsquo;n to keep out such a foe As now is enterd; yet no purpos&rsquo;d foe To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, And mutual amitie so streight, so close, That I with you must dwell, or you with me Henceforth;</p></div> </div>
