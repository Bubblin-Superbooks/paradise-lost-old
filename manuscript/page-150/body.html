<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ning seemd, where bounds were set To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. Satan from hence now on the lower stair That scal&rsquo;d by steps of Gold to Heav&rsquo;n Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once. As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night; at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. Such wonder seis&rsquo;d, though after Heaven seen, The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis&rsquo;d At sight of all this World beheld so faire.</p></div> </div>
