High in the midst exalted as a God Th&rsquo; Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos&rsquo;d With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now &rsquo;Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, A dreadful interval, and Front to Front Presented stood in terrible array Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn&rsquo;d, Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc&rsquo;t, Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; Abdiel that sight endur&rsquo;d not, where he stood Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, And thus his own undaunted heart explores.</p></div> </div>
