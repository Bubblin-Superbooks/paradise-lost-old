<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok&rsquo;t With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-ey&rsquo;d behold? Adam could not, but wept, Though not of Woman born; compassion quell&rsquo;d His best of Man, and gave him up to tears A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, And scarce recovering words his plaint renew&rsquo;d.</p><p>O miserable Mankind, to what fall Degraded, to what wretched state reserv&rsquo;d? Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv&rsquo;n To be thus wrested from us? rather why Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew What we receive, would either not accept Life offer&rsquo;d, or soon beg to lay it down, Glad to be so dismist in peace.</p></div> </div>
