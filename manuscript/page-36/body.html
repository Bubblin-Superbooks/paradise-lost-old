<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With these came they, who from the bordring flood Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, These Feminine. For Spirits when they please Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft And uncompounded is their Essence pure, Not ti&rsquo;d or manacl&rsquo;d with joynt or limb, Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose Dilated or condens&rsquo;t, bright or obscure, Can execute their aerie purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfill. For those the Race of Israel oft forsook Their living strength, and unfrequented left His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low Bow&rsquo;d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear Of despicable foes.</p></div> </div>
