On heav&rsquo;nly ground they stood, and from the shore They view&rsquo;d the vast immeasurable Abyss Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, Up from the bottom turn&rsquo;d by furious windes And surging waves, as Mountains to assault Heav&rsquo;ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.</p><p>Silence, ye troubl&rsquo;d waves, and thou Deep, peace, Said then th&rsquo; Omnific Word, your discord end:</p><p>Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine Follow&rsquo;d in bright procession to behold Creation, and the wonders of his might.</p></div> </div>
