Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, And love with feare the onely God, to walk As in his presence, ever to observe His providence, and on him sole depend, Merciful over all his works, with good Still overcoming evil, and by small Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie, And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.</p>",

Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;</p>",

That ye may live, which will be many dayes, Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer&rsquo;d With meditation on the happie end.</p><p>He ended, and they both descend the Hill; Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak&rsquo;t; And thus with words not sad she him receav&rsquo;d.</p>",

They looking back, all th&rsquo; Eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, Wav&rsquo;d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate With dreadful Faces throng&rsquo;d and fierie Armes: Som natural tears they drop&rsquo;d, but wip&rsquo;d them soon;</p>",
